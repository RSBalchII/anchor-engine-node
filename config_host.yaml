DistillerAgent:
  name: "Distiller"
  role: "Raw Data Analysis Agent"
  goal: >
    Analyze raw, unstructured session logs and conversation transcripts to identify and

  role: "Graph Optimization & RL Agent"
  goal: >
    Periodically analyze the knowledge graph to identify areas for optimization and
    use reinforcement learning to infer new connections.
