# External Context Engine (ECE) - Memory Management System

## Project Overview

The External Context Engine (ECE) is a sophisticated cognitive architecture designed to provide persistent memory and context management for AI systems. This repository contains the implementation of Phase 3 of the ECE, which focuses on creating an intelligent memory management system with Q-Learning powered context retrieval. Version 3.4 enhances the architecture with Universal Tool Calling Protocol (UTCP) integration, replacing bespoke wrapper APIs with standardized tool definitions that can be discovered and called through a central UTCP Tool Registry.

### Architecture

The ECE follows a three-tier architecture:

#### Tier 1: Orchestrator
- **Orchestrator Agent**: The central coordinator that routes prompts to appropriate agents and manages the overall flow using a decision tree for transparent reasoning.

#### Tier 2: Thinkers
- **Thinker Agents**: Specialized reasoning agents that provide different perspectives (Optimist, Pessimist, Creative, Analytical, Pragmatic)
- **Synthesis Agent**: Combines multiple perspectives into a coherent analysis

#### Tier 3: Memory Cortex
- **Archivist Agent**: Master controller of the memory cortex that manages knowledge graph operations
- **QLearning Agent**: Reinforcement learning agent for optimal path finding in the knowledge graph
- **Distiller Agent**: Processes raw text to extract structured information for storage
- **Injector Agent**: Persists structured data to the Neo4j knowledge graph

### Core Components
- **UTCP Tool Registry**: Central service for tool discovery and registration, providing standardized access to all ECE capabilities
- **UTCP Client**: Standardized client library for discovering and calling tools via the registry
- **Context Cache**: Redis-based cache for high-performance context storage
- **Knowledge Graph**: Neo4j database for structured memory storage
- **LLM Integration**: Ollama for local LLM inference

```

## Data Flows

### 1. Universal Context Retrieval Flow (Critical)
This is the foundational, non-negotiable data flow for ALL incoming prompts. It ensures every action is informed by long-term memory.

1. **Ingestion**: The Orchestrator receives the initial prompt from the client (ECE-CLI).
2. **Universal Routing**: The Orchestrator IMMEDIATELY routes the prompt (or its keywords) to the Archivist via UTCP `archivist.get_context` tool. This is a mandatory first step for ALL prompt types (analysis, conversational, memory query).
3. **Graph Query**: The Archivist queries the QLearningAgent using UTCP `qlearning.find_optimal_path` tool for relevant context from the Neo4j knowledge graph.
4. **Context Summarization**: The Archivist receives the context nodes from the QLearningAgent and summarizes them into a coherent context block, including specific examples (code, conversations). The size of this block must be configurable.
5. **Context Injection**: The Archivist returns the enriched, summarized context block to the Orchestrator.
6. **Enriched Execution**: The Orchestrator prepends the enriched context to the original prompt and ONLY THEN routes the new, combined payload to the appropriate agent (Synthesizer, ConversationalAgent, FileSystemAgent, WebSearchAgent, etc.) using UTCP tools for execution.

### 2. Tool Access Flow (Critical for Self-Development)
Defines how the ECE accesses local files and web resources to enable self-modification.

1. **Tool Detection**: The Orchestrator identifies when a prompt requires file or web access using UTCP tool discovery.
2. **Tool Routing**: The Orchestrator routes file/directory requests to FileSystemAgent or web requests to WebSearchAgent via UTCP tools.
3. **File Access**: The FileSystemAgent performs file operations (read, write, create, delete) while respecting security boundaries.
4. **Web Search**: The WebSearchAgent performs online queries using Tavily API for current information.
5. **Result Injection**: Tool results are injected back into the context before final response generation.
6. **Cache Update**: Tool access results are stored in the Redis cache for future reference.

### 3. Complex Reasoning & Output Flow (High Priority)
Defines the correct asynchronous process for handling complex reasoning tasks and delivering results.

1. **Initiation**: The Orchestrator starts the asynchronous reasoning task and returns an `analysis_id` to the client.
2. **Synthesis**: The Synthesizer agent processes the outputs from the Thinker agents into a final, complete analysis.
3. **Result Storage**: The Synthesizer sends the final analysis back to the Orchestrator.
4. **Cache Update**: The Orchestrator MUST store the final analysis in the Redis cache using the format "analysis:<analysis_id>" and update the task status to "complete".
5. **Client Retrieval**: The client can now successfully retrieve the completed analysis by polling the `/get_analysis_result` endpoint with the `analysis_id`.

### 4. Memory Preservation (Cache Truncation) Flow (Medium Priority)
The process for converting short-term memory (cache) into long-term memory (graph) before data is lost.

1. **Periodic Scan**: The Archivist will periodically perform a "tail read" on the Redis Context Cache (e.g., the oldest 1000 characters).
2. **Pre-emptive Archiving**: The Archivist sends this oldest block of context directly to the Injector agent using UTCP `injector.data_to_inject` tool.
3. **Graph Solidification**: The Injector receives the context, performs its de-duplication checks, and writes the information to the Neo4j knowledge graph.

### 5. Self-Development and Code Modification Flow (High Priority)
Enables the ECE to autonomously modify its own codebase based on requirements and feedback.

1. **Self-Modification Trigger**: The Orchestrator identifies when system code changes are needed.
2. **Code Analysis**: The ECE uses UTCP-discovered FileSystemAgent tools to read current implementation files.
3. **Context Integration**: The ECE combines current code context with specifications and requirements.
4. **Code Generation**: Thinker agents generate appropriate code modifications.
5. **Code Writing**: The ECE uses UTCP-discovered FileSystemAgent tools to write updated code.
6. **Verification**: The changes are verified against specifications and stored in the knowledge graph.

### 6. CLI Interaction Flow (Critical for User Experience)
Defines how the ECE-CLI provides the primary interface for user interaction with rich context management.

1. **Session Initialization**: ECE-CLI establishes a persistent session with context preservation across interactions.
2. **Command Processing**: CLI interprets user input and sends to Orchestrator with session context.
3. **Response Formatting**: Orchestrator responses are formatted with rich output (POML emotional lexicon, structured data).
4. **Context Persistence**: Conversation history is maintained across CLI sessions using the context cache.
5. **Multi-turn Interactions**: Complex conversations are supported with memory of previous exchanges.

### 7. Cohesion Loop (Line of Thought) Flow (Low Priority)
The process for the ECE's self-reflection, triggered by an empty prompt.

1. **Trigger**: The Orchestrator receives an empty prompt from the client.
2. **Cache Analysis**: The Orchestrator reads the current content of the Context Cache.
3. **Self-Reflection**: The Orchestrator generates a "thought" or a summary of its current internal state based on the cache contents.
4. **Append to Cache**: This generated "thought" is appended back into the Context Cache, creating a visible "line of thought." This output is NOT sent back to the user.
