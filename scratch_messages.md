Hi Sybil how are you? what will the weather be like later today in Bernalillo? Will you save this conversation to the database? Then I'm thinking of going to a museum in Albuquerque this weekend. Find two different museums and then look up the opening hours for the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science. Then perhaps look up what ice cream places are near the natural history museum as well for me. Thank you! then analyze this directory C:\Users\rsbiiw\Projects\Coding-Notes\Notebook\history\
