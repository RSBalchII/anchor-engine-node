# config.yaml
# Main configuration for the External Context Engine (ECE) using the Youtu-agent framework.

# === LLM Backend Configuration ===
# Defines the language model that will power the agents.
# We'll start with a local Ollama model for speed and sovereignty.
llm:
  provider: ollama
  config:
    model: "deepseek-coder:6.7b"
    # You can add other Ollama parameters here if needed, e.g., temperature.

# === Agent Definitions ===
# This section defines each agent in our architecture.

OrchestraAgent:
  name: "Orchestrator"
  role: "Central coordinator for the ECE."
  goal: >
    Receive user requests, understand intent, and delegate tasks to the appropriate specialist agents
    (Distiller, Archivist, Extractor, Injector) to fulfill the request.
  # The Orchestrator will have access to all other agents as its "tools".
  tools:
    - DistillerAgent
    - ArchivistAgent
    - ExtractorAgent
    - InjectorAgent

DistillerAgent:
  name: "Distiller"
  role: "Raw Data Analysis Agent"
  goal: >
    Analyze raw, unstructured session logs and conversation transcripts to identify and
    summarize high-coherency insights and key conceptual relationships.

ArchivistAgent:
  name: "Archivist"
  role: "Knowledge Graph Persistence Agent"
  goal: >
    Take the distilled insights from the DistillerAgent and persist them into the
    Neo4j knowledge graph, creating and updating nodes and relationships.

ExtractorAgent:
  name: "Extractor"
  role: "Knowledge Retrieval Agent"
  goal: >
    Receive specific queries from the Orchestrator, traverse the Neo4j knowledge graph
    to find the most relevant information, and return it as a structured context.

InjectorAgent:
  name: "Injector"
  role: "Graph Optimization & RL Agent"
  goal: >
    Periodically analyze the knowledge graph to identify areas for optimization.
    Use reinforcement learning techniques to infer new connections and refine existing
    relationships to improve the graph's overall utility.
