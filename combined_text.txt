# Context-Engine Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **CozoDB Corruption Recovery**: Enhanced error handling for IndexedDB corruption with automatic fallback to in-memory database, manual recovery button, and timeout protection against hanging WASM calls.
- **Bulk CozoDB Import Tool**: Added `tools/prepare_cozo_import.py` to transform `combined_memory.json` into the canonical `relations` payload (`cozo_import_memory.json`) for atomic bulk imports into CozoDB.
- **Import Safety & Verification**: Added recommended import procedure and a post-import verification + backup step to avoid Schema Detachment.

### Changed
- **Ingestion Defaults**: Recommended batch size increased to 100 to prevent long-running slow writes that can desync CozoDB's in-memory metadata.

---

# Context Engine (Sovereign Edition)

> **Philosophy:** Your mind, augmented. Your data, sovereign. Your tools, open.

A **Browser-Native** cognitive extraction system. No servers. No cloud. No installation.
Just you, your browser, and your infinite context.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

1.  **Download** this repository.
2.  **Open** `tools/index.html` in Chrome or Edge.
3.  **Click** "Double Click to Launch" on the Console.

*That's it. You are running a local LLM with persistent Graph Memory.*

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system runs entirely in `tools/` using WebAssembly (WASM).

### 1. The Sovereign Loop
```mermaid
graph TD
    User -->|Input| HTML[model-server-chat.html]
    
    subgraph Browser_Memory ["Two Birds, One Stone"]
        HTML -->|Store/Retrieve| Cozo["CozoDB WASM"]
        Cozo -->|Persist| IDB["IndexedDB/OPFS"]
    end
    
    subgraph Cognitive_Engine
        HTML -->|Context + Prompt| WebLLM["DeepSeek-R1 (WASM)"]
        WebLLM -->|Reasoning Trace| HTML
    end
```

### 2. Core Components
*   **Brain**: `model-server-chat.html` - Runs the Graph-R1 Reasoning Loop.
*   **Memory**: `CozoDB (WASM)` - Stores relations (`*memory`) and vectors. Persists to browser IndexedDB.
*   **Stomach**: `sovereign-db-builder.html` - Ingests files (Markdown/JSON) into the graph.

# Documentation Policy (Context-Engine)

**Master Policy for all directories. Code is authoritative; documentation supports it.**

---

## Rule 1: Minimize Documentation

- Code is the source of truth. Documentation explains *why* and guides *how*, but never replaces code.
- Default assumption: No docs needed unless setup is genuinely ambiguous or painful.
- LLM-generated reference docs are archived to `/archive/` after they're used.

---

## Rule 2: Allowed Documentation Per Directory

### Root Level
- **README.md** — 100 words. Answer: "What is this repo?"
- **CHANGELOG.md** — Version history and major changes
- **STARTUP.md** — Quick start (if needed)
- **specs/** — Central spec layer (see Rule 3)

### `backend/`, `tools/`, `extension/`, `scripts/`
- **README.md** — Single sentence. Answer: "What does this directory do?"
- **CONFIGURATION.md** — Only if env setup is non-obvious (backend only)
- **No additional .md files** in directory root (see Rule 3)

### `backend/src/`, `tools/src/`, `extension/src/`
- No separate documentation. Inline code comments with `#file:specs/...` references.

---

## Rule 3: Specification Layer (`specs/`)

The `specs/` directory is the **single source of architectural truth**.

### Core Files
- **spec.md** — High-level system architecture (read this first)
- **plan.md** — Roadmap and phases
- **tasks.md** — Implementation task queue
- **doc_policy.md** — This file (documentation governance)
- **mlc-urls.md** — Registry of verified MLC-LLM model URLs (see Rule 3.1)

### Architecture Subdirectory
- **specs/architecture/** — Deep technical specifications
  - **sovereign-wasm.spec.md** — Browser-native layer (WebGPU, CozoDB, model-server-chat, builder)
  - **memory-layer.spec.md** — Neo4j/Redis architecture and schemas
  - **extension-bridge.spec.md** — Chrome extension design (injection, pause triggers)
  - **agents.spec.md** — Agent system (Verifier, Distiller, Archivist)
  - **api.spec.md** — FastAPI endpoints and protocols

### Where Each Spec Goes
- **Architectural overview or design decisions?** → `specs/spec.md`
- **Multi-phase roadmap?** → `specs/plan.md`
- **Implementation tasks?** → `specs/tasks.md`
- **Deep technical details** (schemas, data flow, algorithms)? → `specs/architecture/<domain>.spec.md`
- **Local directory context** (e.g., "what does scripts/ do")? → `README.md` in that directory

---

## Rule 4: Deprecated/Generated Documentation

All LLM-generated reference documentation (tutorials, examples, detailed walkthroughs) should be:
1. **Used locally** (for context during development)
2. **Archived to `/archive/`** after they served their purpose
3. **Never** left in active project root or major directories

Examples of archived docs:
- `archive/docs_removed/` — Outdated technical docs
- `archive/anchor/` — Deprecated CLI interface docs
- `archive/setup_docs/` — Legacy setup guides

---

## Rule 5: Cross-Referencing Specs

Within any spec file, use markdown links to other specs:

```markdown
For memory architecture, see [Memory Layer Spec](architecture/memory-layer.spec.md).
For browser integration, see [Sovereign WASM Spec](architecture/sovereign-wasm.spec.md).
```

In code files, use comments to reference specs:
```python
# Graph-R1 reasoning flow (see specs/architecture/agents.spec.md)
def graph_r1_query():
    pass
```

---

## Rule 6: Truth Precedence

If **code conflicts with documentation**:
1. Code is correct
2. Update the relevant spec file immediately
3. Add a git note explaining the discrepancy

If **multiple specs conflict**:
1. `spec.md` is authoritative for architecture
2. `architecture/*.spec.md` fills in implementation details
3. Code is the final arbiter

---

## Rule 7: Reality Constraint

Documentation must never:
- Contradict the "Empirical Distrust" protocol (retrieve > internal knowledge)
- Promise features not implemented in code
- Reference deprecated repositories or APIs without clear deprecation notices

---

## Enforcement

- **Review checklist:** Before merging PRs, verify no new .md files are scattered (should only be in specs/ or as single README.md per directory)
- **Quarterly cleanup:** Archive generated/reference docs older than 3 months
- **Broken links:** Use `specs/architecture/` links; verify they exist before committing

---

## Quick Reference

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where's the architecture? | `specs/spec.md` |
| Where's the roadmap? | `specs/plan.md` |
| Where are the tasks? | `specs/tasks.md` |
| How do I set up the backend? | `backend/CONFIGURATION.md` |
| What's in tools/? | `tools/README.md` |
| How do I understand WASM layer? | `specs/architecture/sovereign-wasm.spec.md` |
| How do Neo4j/Redis work? | `specs/architecture/memory-layer.spec.md` |
| How does the extension work? | `specs/architecture/extension-bridge.spec.md` |
| Where are old docs? | `archive/docs_removed/` |

## CozoDB Import Format & Recovery

**Purpose:** Describe the canonical JSON format used for bulk imports into the browser CozoDB instance and recovery steps when a Schema Detachment occurs.

**Note:** As of HTML pivot, CozoDB runs entirely in browser WASM with IndexedDB persistence. Recovery procedures apply to browser-native tools in `tools/` directory.

### Canonical Import JSON
CozoDB expects a top-level JSON object with a `relations` array. Each relation should look like this:

```json
{
  "relations": [
    {
      "name": "memory",
      "headers": ["id","timestamp","role","content","source","embedding"],
      "rows": [
        ["id-1", 1688790000000, "system", "file text...", "path/to/file.md", null],
        [...]
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `id`: string, unique identifier (UUID or deterministic hash)
- `timestamp`: integer, Unix ms
- `role`: string, e.g., `system` or `user`
- `content`: string, textual content (truncate if exceedingly large)
- `source`: string, origin path or descriptor
- `embedding`: either an array of floats (embedding vector) or `null` if embeddings will be computed later

### Recovery: Schema Detachment
When `export_relations({})` returns `{"message":"missing field `relations` ..."}` or queries report `query::relation_not_found`:
1. Attempt non-destructive reattach:
```js
await window.db.run(":create memory { id: String => timestamp: Int, role: String, content: String, source: String, embedding: <F32; 384> } IF NOT EXISTS");
```
2. If reattach fails, export raw OPFS/IndexedDB blobs and decode them locally using `tools/decode_cozo_blob.py`.
3. Prefer bulk import from canonical source (`cozo_import_memory.json`) rather than reimporting individual rows.

### Tooling & Best Practices
- Use `tools/prepare_cozo_import.py` to create `cozo_import_memory.json` from `combined_memory.json`.
- For a guaranteed atomic result: nuke the DB and `Force Import Relations from JSON` (or use `db.import_relations(payload)` in Console) with the produced file.
- After import, run `export_relations({})` and persist the result (backup) plus verify by running `?[count] := *memory{id}`.

# Verified MLC Model Registry

**Status:** Living Document
**Purpose:** Centralize trusted, verified URLs for MLC-LLM models and WASM libraries to prevent cache errors and guessing games.

## Protocol for Adding
1. **Verify** the URL returns 200 OK (use `curl -I`).
2. **Test** the model loads in `model-server-chat.html` (or equivalent).
3. **Commit** the entry here.

# Architecture Overview: Root Coda (v2.0)

**Status:** Production (Root Architecture)
**Philosophy:** 100% Local, 100% Browser, 100% Sovereign.

## Core Stack

The system has evolved into **Root Coda**, a pure [WASM (WebAssembly)](https://webassembly.org/) ecosystem where the browser is the Operating System.

### 1. The Kernel (`sovereign.js`)
- **Role:** The central nervous system.
- **Function:**
  - **Unified Logging:** Broadcasts to `log-viewer` and Mission Control.
  - **Reactive State:** Zero-dependency `Proxy` store for UI state.
  - **Hardware Abstraction:** "Snapdragon Fix" (WebGPU buffer clamping) and Profile management.
  - **Memory Driver:** Standardized CozoDB WASM initialization.

### 2. The Compute (`web-llm`)
- **Engine:** [WebLLM](https://webllm.mlc.ai/) (MLC-AI)
- **Runtime:** WebGPU (Hardware accelerated)
- **Models:**
  - **Lite:** Qwen2.5-1.5B / Llama-3.2-1B (Mobile/Snapdragon)
  - **Mid:** Qwen2.5-7B / Mistral-7B (8GB VRAM)
  - **High:** Qwen2.5-14B / DeepSeek-R1 (16GB+ VRAM)

### 3. The Memory (`cozo-lib-wasm`)
- **Database:** [CozoDB](https://cozodb.org/) (Datalog/Relational/Graph)
- **Storage:** IndexedDB / OPFS (Origin Private File System) -> Persistent.
- **Schema:**
  - `*memory`: Stored relations (content, timestamp, embedding).
  - `*vectors`: HNSW vector index for semantic search.

### 4. The Interfaces (Root Tools)
- **Root Console** (`model-server-chat.html`): The **Brain**. Runs Graph-R1 reasoning loop.
- **Root Builder** (`sovereign-db-builder.html`): The **Stomach**. Ingests files/logs into the Graph.
- **Root Mic** (`sovereign-mic.html`): The **Ears**. Whisper-Tiny (WASM) + LLM cleanup.
- **Log Viewer** (`log-viewer.html`): The **Nerves**. System-wide diagnostics.

## Data Flow

    User -->|Voice| Mic[Root Mic]
    User -->|Files| Builder[Root Builder]
    User -->|Chat| Console[Root Console]

        Console -->|Query| Cozo
        Cozo -->|Persist| IDB[IndexedDB]
    end
```

## Critical Workflows

### 1. The Reasoning Loop (Graph-R1)
1. User input triggers **Reflex** (Keyword/Vector search in CozoDB).
2. **Context Manager** assembles a "Virtual Prompt" with retrieved clues.
3. LLM executes **R1 Loop**:
   - If answer found: Synthesize.
   - If missing info: Request specific search (`NEED_CONTEXT: term`).
4. Final answer streamed to user.

### 2. Sovereign Persistence
- **Zero Backend:** Python is only used for serving static files (`http.server`).
- **Portability:** The entire "Brain" is contained in `browser_data` and IndexedDB.

## Data Flow: Query → Inject

```
Step 1: User types "Tell me about Chronos" in Gemini
  ↓
Step 2: Content script detects 3-second pause
  ↓
Step 3: Send message to background worker: {action: 'queryMemories', query: '...'}
  ↓
Step 4: Background worker queries memories
  (Option A: /memories/search endpoint if backend available)
  (Option B: Direct CozoDB query if local store accessible)
  ↓
Step 5: Return top-3 memories + summary
  {
    success: true,
    memories: [
      {id: "123", content: "Chronos is about time management..."},
      {id: "124", content: "In July session..."},
      {id: "125", content: "Key insight: context rotation..."}
    ],
    summary: "[Memory 1] Chronos is about... [Memory 2] In July... [Memory 3] Key insight..."
  }
  ↓
Step 6: Content script injects into textarea:
  "Tell me about Chronos
   
   [Sovereign Context Injection at 14:32:05]
   [Memory 1] Chronos is about time management...
   [Memory 2] In July session we discovered...
   [Memory 3] Key insight: context rotation prevents token loss...
   ---"
  ↓
Step 7: User presses Enter → Gemini processes augmented prompt
  ↓
Step 8: Response includes your memory context!
```

---

## Trigger Mechanisms

### Primary: 3-Second Pause

```javascript
// User stops typing → wait 3 seconds → trigger query
const PAUSE_THRESHOLD = 3000;
let pauseTimer;

textArea.addEventListener('input', () => {
  clearTimeout(pauseTimer);
  pauseTimer = setTimeout(() => triggerMemoryQuery(), PAUSE_THRESHOLD);
});
```

### Secondary: Manual Hotkey (Optional)

```javascript
// Ctrl+Shift+M to manually inject
document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
  if (e.ctrlKey && e.shiftKey && e.code === 'KeyM') {
    triggerMemoryQuery();
  }
});
```

---

## Context Injection Format

### Option 1: Append to User Text
```
Tell me about Project Chronos

[Sovereign Context - Memories]
[Mem 1] Project Chronos explores infinite context windows...
[Mem 2] Discovered in July: context rotation is key...
[Mem 3] Verifier agent reduces hallucinations...
---
```

### Option 2: System Instruction (if API allows)
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You have access to these contextual memories: [Mem 1] ... [Mem 2] ..."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Tell me about Project Chronos"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Configuration & Settings

**User-Configurable (popup.js):**
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  pauseThreshold: 3000,           // 3 seconds
  maxMemoriesToInject: 3,          // Top 3
  injectionFormat: 'append',       // or 'system-instruction'
  enabledSites: {
    'gemini.google.com': true,
    'chatgpt.openai.com': true
  },
  backendUrl: 'http://localhost:8000',
  fallbackToLocal: true            // Use local CozoDB if backend down
};
```

---

## Error Handling

### Scenario 1: Backend Unavailable
```
→ Fall back to local CozoDB (if accessible)
→ If local unavailable, show status: "⚠ No memories available"
```

### Scenario 2: No Relevant Memories Found
```
→ Display indicator: "No relevant memories found"
→ Still allow user to submit normally
```

### Scenario 3: Injection Failed
```
→ Show error: "Failed to inject context"
→ Allow user to retry manually via button
```

---

## Performance Targets

- **Pause detection latency:** < 50ms
- **Memory query latency:** < 100ms (local) or < 500ms (backend)
- **Injection latency:** < 50ms
- **Total E2E:** < 150ms (user should not notice delay)

---

## Privacy & Security

- **Local-first:** All queries stay on user's machine
- **No logging:** Extension doesn't upload queries to external services
- **User control:** Manual disable via popup toggle
- **Memory source:** Only accesses local CozoDB, never user's active Gemini text

---

## Platform Adaptations

### For Gemini
- **Text Area:** `div[contenteditable="true"]`
- **Submission:** Detect Enter key or "Send" button click
- **Format:** Append to contenteditable div

### For ChatGPT
- **Text Area:** `textarea`
- **Submission:** Detect Enter or Ctrl+Enter
- **Format:** Append to textarea value

### Future: Claude, Copilot, etc.
- Extend `host_permissions` in manifest
- Add platform-specific selector in `content.js`

# Sovereign Memory Architecture (CozoDB + WASM)

**Status:** Active (Production)
**Implementation:** `tools/sovereign-db-builder.html` and `tools/model-server-chat.html`

The memory layer is a **Browser-Native Hybrid Graph-Vector Database** running entirely in WebAssembly (WASM). It consolidates the roles of the legacy Redis (Cache) and Neo4j (Graph) into a single, persistent CozoDB instance backed by IndexedDB/OPFS.

---

## 1. Core Schema (`*memory`)

The system uses a single unified relation for all ingested knowledge, serving both as the "Long Term Memory" and the source for "Context Injection".

### Datalog Definition
```datalog
:create memory {
    id: String
    =>
    timestamp: Int,         # Unix Epoch (ms) - Used for sorting/recency
    role: String,           # 'user', 'assistant', 'system'
    content: String,        # The raw text (truncated at 20KB for WASM stability)
    source: String,         # File path or 'session'
    embedding: <F32; 384>   # Vector for semantic search (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
}
```

### Fields
*   **`id`** *(Key)*: Unique identifier. Format: `Timestamp-RandomID`.
*   **`timestamp`**: Time of creation. Critical for "Recent Memory" retrieval.
*   **`role`**: Speaker identity.
*   **`content`**: The actual knowledge or chat message.
*   **`source`**: Provenance (e.g., `logs/session-123.json` or `specs/spec.md`).
*   **`embedding`**: 384-dimensional vector generated by `transformers.js`.

---

## 2. Persistence (The "Sovereign Loop")

1.  **Write**: Data is written to CozoDB (WASM memory).
2.  **Flush**: CozoDB automatically syncs to **IndexedDB** (`coda_memory` / `cozo_store`).
3.  **Load**: On page refresh, the app probes IndexedDB and rehydrates the CozoDB instance.

> **Zero-Loss Guarantee:** If the CozoDB instance crashes or the tab is closed, data is safe in IndexedDB.

---

## 3. Retrieval Strategies

### A. Graph-R1 Recency (Default)
Retrieves the most recent context to ground the reasoning loop.
```datalog
?[timestamp, role, source, content] := 
    *memory{timestamp, role, source, content}
    :sort -timestamp
    :limit 20
```

### B. Semantic Search (Vector)
Retrieves context based on embedding similarity (Cosine distance).
```datalog
?[id, dist] := 
    *memory{id, embedding},
    vec_l2(embedding, $query_vec)
    :limit 10
```

---

## 4. Import / Export

*   **Import**: Drag & Drop `combined_memory.json` into `sovereign-db-builder.html`.
*   **Export**: The builder allows exporting the full graph (with embeddings) to JSON for backup or transfer between devices.

# Sovereign WASM Specification (Root Kernel)

## Architecture Overview
The **Root Coda** system runs entirely in the browser using a unified Kernel (`sovereign.js`) that manages Compute (WebLLM) and Memory (CozoDB).

## 1. The Kernel (`tools/modules/sovereign.js`)
The Kernel is the standard library for all Root Tools. It enforces consistency and safety.

### 1.1 Hardware Abstraction ("Snapdragon Fix")
**Problem**: Adreno GPUs (Snapdragon X Elite) and some mobile chips crash if a WebGPU buffer >256MB is requested, or if context exceeds 4k tokens without specific driver flags.
**Solution**: `getWebGPUConfig(profile)`
- **Lite**: Clamps buffer to 256MB, Context to 2048.
- **Mid**: Clamps buffer to 1GB, Context to 4096.
- **High/Ultra**: Unlocked.

### 1.2 Unified Logging
**Problem**: `console.log` is invisible on mobile or when running as a PWA.
**Solution**: `SovereignLogger`
- Broadcasts all logs to `BroadcastChannel('sovereign-logs')`.
- Consumed by `log-viewer.html` for real-time remote debugging.

### 1.3 Reactive State
**Problem**: Spaghetti code updating DOM elements manually.
**Solution**: `createStore(initialState)`
- Lightweight `Proxy`-based store.
- Components subscribe to changes: `subscribe((key, val) => updateUI(key, val))`.

## 2. Memory Layer (CozoDB WASM)
The Kernel provides a standardized loader: `initCozo(wasmPath)`.

### Schema
```datalog
:create memory {
    id: String 
    => 
    timestamp: Int, 
    role: String, 
    content: String, 
    source: String, 
    embedding: <F32; 384> 
}
```

## 3. Tool Bridge (Legacy Support)
The `webgpu_bridge.py` acts as a secure relay (websocket <-> http) for external tools (like VS Code extensions) to access the Browser's LLM.
- **Input**: HTTP/REST (`/v1/chat/completions`)
- **Output**: WebSocket (`ws://localhost:8080/ws/chat`)

## Requirements

*   **Browser**: Chrome 113+, Edge 113+ (WebGPU required)
*   **GPU**: WebGPU-compatible (most modern GPUs)
*   **RAM**: 4GB+ for 7B models, 2GB+ for 1.5B models
*   **Storage**: IndexedDB for persistent memory (browser-managed)

## Corruption Recovery

If you see "Failed to convert Uint8Array to Vec<u8>" or WASM panics:
1. Click **🚨 Recover from Crash** button (appears automatically)
2. Or use **Nuke Database** for complete reset
3. Data export available before recovery for backup

## Quick Start: Zero Dependencies

### Option 1: Direct HTML (Recommended)
1. Open `tools/index.html` in Chrome/Edge
2. Click **Model Server Chat** → Select model → Start chatting
3. Click **Memory Builder** → Ingest your data
4. All processing happens in-browser via WebGPU/WASM

### Option 2: Extension Integration (Optional)
Install Chrome extension for automatic page context injection
