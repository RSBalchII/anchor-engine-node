# ECE_Core Citations

The following references and research papers are cited across the ECE_Core repository documentation and architecture.

- Graph-R1 (Memory Retrieval Patterns): https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21892
- Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM): https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734
- HopRAG (Graph-structured Retrieval): https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.XXXXX
- Large LLM production best practices & multi-hop retrieval: multiple references archived in `specs/` and `archive/`.

- Croto: Multi-Agent Collaboration via Cross-Team Orchestration (Croto) — foundational blueprint for Phase 5 (Matrix/Factory) cross-team orchestration, Greedy aggregation, and hierarchical partitioning. (Add full citation on team decision and adoption.)

- Multi-Agent Collaboration via Cross-Team Orchestration (Croto): https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx (2025)

Notes:
- Croto is a multi-agent orchestration architecture that proposes Cross-Team Orchestration, Greedy Aggregation, and Hierarchical Partitioning to scale reasoning and implement 'Matrix' style parallel team orchestration. This architecture directly informs Phase 5 (Matrix/Factory) of ECE_Core.
 - Croto (Cross-Team Orchestration): Multi-Agent Collaboration via Cross-Team Orchestration (Croto) — Architectural blueprint for multi-team orchestration and greedy aggregation (Phase 5: The Matrix/Factory). https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx
