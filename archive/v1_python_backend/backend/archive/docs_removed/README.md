# Archived Documentation

This folder contains documentation files that have been intentionally archived as part of the project's documentation consolidation and `specs/doc_policy.md`.

Why archived
- These files were moved to this folder to keep `specs/` focused and avoid duplication.
- They remain for historical context and reference only.

Active docs
- The active documentation should live under `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `specs/` (see `specs/doc_policy.md`)

If you need to restore or reference archived docs, use the copies in this folder; otherwise please consult the `specs/` set of documents for authoritative, current documentation.
