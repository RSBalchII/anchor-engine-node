# ECE Ecosystem (Archived)

This document provided a detailed end-to-end startup and architecture view of the full ECE ecosystem. It was archived as part of a documentation consolidation to keep `specs/` focused and minimal.

Original contents included:
- LLM (llama-server) startup instructions
- ECE_Core startup & ports
- Anchor TUI startup
- Component purpose and port map
- Troubleshooting and shutdown steps

For current startup and operational instructions, see:
- `specs/spec.md` - technical architecture
- `specs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - debugging & health checks
