# Archived Documentation Index

This folder holds documentation that was removed from the active `specs/` set and archived as part of the doc consolidation policy.

Files:
- `retrieval_README.md` - Previously at `retrieval/README.md`, contains retrieval & reasoning docs (Graph-R1, Q-Learning, C2C KV-cache fusion)
- `data_pipeline_README.md` - Previously at `data_pipeline/README.md`, data import & ETL scripts
- `utils_README.md` - Previously at `utils/README.md`, developer convenience scripts
- `ecosystem.md` - Full system startup guide (archived, pointer retained in `specs/ecosystem.md`)
- `neo4j_migration.md` - Neo4j migration & setup details (archived, pointer retained)

Purpose: Provide a historical archive so that the active `specs/` docs can remain small and remain the single source of truth.

If a file is needed for reference, consult it here. These files are not intended to be used as active documentation in the project's day-to-day operations.
