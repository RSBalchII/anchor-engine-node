# Archive Folder - ECE_Core

This folder contains archived materials that are kept for historical purposes, debugging, or reference but are not part of the active code path. The content is intended for future reference or migration tasks and should not be considered production code.

What you'll find here:
- `core_legacy/` - Legacy versions of core modules that existed before refactor/migration. Useful for reference when tracking older APIs or debugging regressions.
- `data_pipeline/`, `db/`, `legacy_sqlite/` - Migration helpers and previous storage formats (SQLite-based helpers). These are archived after the Neo4j migration.
- `docs_removed/` - Documentation files that were moved out of `specs/` per `specs/doc_policy.md`. They are kept for archival, not as the current canonical docs.
- `scripts/` and `migrate_*.py` - Tools used for migration, data import, and one-time repair jobs. Many are safe but avoid running them on production without a DB backup.
- `archive/INDEX.md` - High level summary of important archived artifacts (see below).

Safe-to-delete guidance:
- Files in this folder are historical and generally safe to delete if you are sure you don't need old migrations, example data, or legacy docs. Keep `migrate_*` scripts if you plan to re-run imports.

If you're unsure what something is for, re-run the migration in a staging environment or open an issue referencing the file path.

----
Addendum: `removed_tool_protocols` has been deleted from the active archive to reduce confusion. If you previously referenced MCP artifacts, they are still preserved under `docs_removed` as needed.

## LEGACY: SQLite & Migration Materials

Many files under this folder reference or directly depend on SQLite / `aiosqlite`.
They are archived for historical and migration purposes only. These include migration
and importer scripts, backup importers, and other utilities that previously supported
SQLite as a memory backend. Examples include `import_combined.py`, `import_to_graph.py`,
`import_memory.py`, `migrate_summaries_to_neo4j.py`, and `simple_importer.py.bak`.

Recommended usage:
1. Make a backup of your `ece_memory.db` and Neo4j exports before attempting any migration.
2. Install optional dependency `aiosqlite` if you plan to run these scripts (`pip install aiosqlite`).
3. Set `ECE_ALLOW_LEGACY_SQLITE=1` in your environment to avoid accidental usage in active deployments.
4. Only run these scripts in an isolated environment (staging or local dev) and follow the migration workflow.

Contact: If you're unsure, open an issue or consult `ece-core/specs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for migration guidance.
