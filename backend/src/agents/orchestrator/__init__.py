"""Cross-Team Orchestrator (Croto) skeleton for Phase 5.

This module provides a minimal orchestration skeleton that will be used to manage
multiple Planner/Agent 'teams', orchestrate a cross-team planning process, and
perform greedy aggregation of the teams' ideas.

This is intentionally a skeleton to be extended in future iterations.
