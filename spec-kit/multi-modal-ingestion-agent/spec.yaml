# MultiModalIngestionAgent Specification

## Agent Overview
The MultiModalIngestionAgent is a specialized agent designed to process non-textual data (images, audio) by generating textual descriptions and extracting key concepts for the knowledge graph. It feeds structured text derived from multi-modal inputs to the DistillerAgent.

## Key Responsibilities
- Process various types of non-textual input (images, audio files, video)
- Generate accurate textual descriptions of the content
- Extract key concepts and entities from the content
- Format the information for consumption by the DistillerAgent

## Integration Points
- Receives multi-modal inputs from the Orchestrator
- Feeds processed text to the DistillerAgent
- May interact with the ExtractorAgent to check for related existing knowledge

## Technical Requirements
- Image processing capabilities (OCR, object detection, scene description)
- Audio processing capabilities (speech-to-text, sound classification)
- Video processing capabilities (frame extraction, scene analysis)
- Integration with AI models for content analysis (e.g., CLIP for images, Whisper for audio)

## Success Metrics
- Accuracy of textual descriptions
- Completeness of concept extraction
- Speed of processing
- Quality of generated metadata

## Edge Cases
- Unsupported file formats
- Corrupted or low-quality input files
- Content with no recognizable features
- Processing time exceeding limits

## Implementation Considerations
- Privacy and data handling compliance
- Large file handling and memory management
- Model selection for different content types
- Cost optimization for cloud-based processing services
