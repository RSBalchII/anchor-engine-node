# WebSearchAgent Specification

## Agent Overview
The WebSearchAgent is a specialized agent designed to enrich the knowledge graph with real-time, external information from the web. It acts as a new data source that feeds the DistillerAgent with relevant external content.

## Key Responsibilities
- Perform web searches based on user queries or system needs
- Extract and process relevant information from search results
- Format the information for consumption by the DistillerAgent
- Ensure search results are relevant and from credible sources

## Integration Points
- Receives queries from the Orchestrator
- Feeds processed results to the DistillerAgent
- May interact with the ExtractorAgent to check for existing knowledge

## Technical Requirements
- Web search API integration (e.g., Google Search API, Bing Search API)
- Content extraction and parsing capabilities
- Source credibility assessment
- Rate limiting and error handling

## Success Metrics
- Relevance of search results to the query
- Speed of search and processing
- Diversity of sources
- Accuracy of extracted information

## Edge Cases
- No relevant search results found
- API rate limits exceeded
- Unavailable or slow search services
- Content from low-credibility sources

## Implementation Considerations
- Privacy and data handling compliance
- Caching of search results to reduce API calls
- Filtering of potentially harmful or inappropriate content
- Localization and language support
