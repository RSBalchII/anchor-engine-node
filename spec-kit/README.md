# Spec-Kit Directory

This directory contains the specification packages for the External Context Engine (ECE) project, following the GitHub Spec-Kit methodology.

## Structure

- `web-search-agent/` - Specification for the WebSearchAgent
- `multi-modal-ingestion-agent/` - Specification for the MultiModalIngestionAgent
- `coherence-agent/` - Specification for the CoherenceAgent
- `safety-agent/` - Specification for the SafetyAgent

## Purpose

Each agent specification follows the Spec-Kit methodology to ensure clear, comprehensive, and implementable designs. These specifications will guide the implementation of the new agents in the ECE system.

## Usage

Each agent directory contains a `spec.yaml` file that defines:
- Agent overview and responsibilities
- Integration points with other system components
- Technical requirements
- Success metrics
- Edge cases
- Implementation considerations

## Next Steps

The development team should review these specifications and begin implementation according to the phased approach outlined in the main README.
