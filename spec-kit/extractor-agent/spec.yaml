- Connects to external web services and chatbots
- Sends raw extracted data to the DistillerAgent
- Does not store or process data independently

## Technical Requirements
- Secure connection mechanisms to various online services
- Web scraping capabilities for conversation extraction
- Data transmission protocols to communicate with DistillerAgent
- Ephemeral data handling without local storage

## Success Metrics
- Successful connection to specified online services
- Complete extraction of conversation text
- Accurate transmission of raw data to DistillerAgent
- Zero local data storage incidents

## Edge Cases
- Connection failures to external services
- Partial conversation extraction due to service limitations
- Network interruptions during data transmission
- Authentication requirements for protected services

## Implementation Considerations
- Compliance with website terms of service and legal requirements
- Handling of different conversation formats and structures
- Security measures for data in transit
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
