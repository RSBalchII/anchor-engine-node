# Spec-Kit Installation and Setup

The spec-kit has been successfully installed and initialized in the project. The following steps were taken:

1. Installed the `elysia` package in the virtual environment.
2. Initialized the project with spec-kit from the GitHub repository using the command:
   ```bash
   uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init External-Context-Engine --ai copilot
   ```
3. The spec-kit has created a new directory structure with templates and guidelines for spec-driven development.
4. The old spec-kit report and the SpecKitInstallerAgent POML file have been removed.

The project is now ready to use the spec-kit methodology for development.
