## Key Enhancement Areas

1. **Path Finding Improvements**
   - APOC Path Expansion for configurable traversal
   - A* Algorithm for informed search
   - Multiple algorithm strategies

2. **Centrality Analysis**
   - PageRank, Betweenness, and Closeness centrality
   - Centrality-guided exploration
   - Dynamic state prioritization

3. **Similarity-Based Learning**
   - Node2Vec embeddings for state representations
   - Vector similarity search
   - Transfer learning between similar states

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Virtual graphs for temporary exploration
   - Batch operations for efficiency
   - Query optimization techniques

## Implementation Roadmap

The enhancements are organized into three phases:

1. **Phase 1 (1-2 weeks)**: Immediate improvements with high impact
2. **Phase 2 (3-4 weeks)**: Medium-term enhancements for scalability
3. **Phase 3 (5-8 weeks)**: Advanced features for cutting-edge capabilities

## Expected Benefits

- 20-30% improvement in path finding performance
- 15-25% reduction in training time
- Better handling of large state spaces
- Enhanced scalability for complex knowledge graphs
