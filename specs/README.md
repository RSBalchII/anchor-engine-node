# Spec Package Index

This repository uses the GitHub Spec-Kit methodology to drive development. This index points to the authoritative specs for the Memory Management System (MMS).

Phases and artifacts:
- Analysis: specs/memory-management-system/current-state-analysis.md
- Feature Specification: specs/memory-management-system/feature-spec.md
- Implementation Plan: specs/memory-management-system/implementation-plan.md
- Tasks: specs/memory-management-system/tasks.md
- Validation: specs/memory-management-system/validation-report.md
- Roadmap: specs/memory-management-system/implementation-roadmap.md

Usage:
- Run `make spec-index` to (re)generate the spec manifest with checksums
- Run `make spec-validate` to verify that the codebase and changesets are compliant with the specs
