# External Context Engine

The External Context Engine is an AI-powered system that processes and extracts information from various data sources, generating targeted queries for knowledge graph searches. It features multiple specialist agents that handle different types of processing tasks.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for different processing tasks
- **Multi-Format Support**: Handles text files, PDFs, DOCX documents, and HTML content
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Generates optimized queries for knowledge graph searches
- **Flexible Configuration**: YAML-based configuration system
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests for all components

## Specialist Agents

### ArchivistAgent
The ArchivistAgent is responsible for managing the knowledge graph by storing and retrieving structured information using Neo4j as the persistence layer.

**Key Features:**
- Store entities and relationships in the knowledge graph
- Retrieve information using Cypher queries
- Update existing entities and relationships
- Delete entities and relationships
- Integration with the main application through chat interface or direct API endpoints

For detailed documentation, see [ArchivistAgent Documentation](docs/archivist_agent.md).

### ExtractorAgent
The ExtractorAgent is responsible for extracting specific information from unstructured data sources and generating targeted queries for the knowledge graph.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-format support (text, PDF, DOCX, HTML)
- Flexible extraction criteria (keywords, patterns, entities)
- Knowledge graph query generation
- Performance monitoring
- Comprehensive error handling

For detailed documentation, see [ExtractorAgent Documentation](docs/extractor_agent.md).

### DistillerAgent
The DistillerAgent is responsible for distilling raw text into structured, meaningful data. It identifies entities, relationships, and key points from the text and structures them for storage in the knowledge graph.

**Key Features:**
- Entity recognition (people, organizations, locations, etc.)
- Relationship extraction between identified entities
- Key point identification from text
- Data structuring for knowledge graph storage
- Performance optimization with caching
- Comprehensive error handling

For detailed documentation, see [DistillerAgent Documentation](docs/distiller_agent.md).

### QLearningGraphAgent
The QLearningGraphAgent is a Reinforcement Learning-based graph navigation system that intelligently traverses the knowledge graph to find the most relevant information for complex queries.

**Key Features:**
- Q-Learning algorithm for graph navigation
- Path finding with Q-value guidance
- Q-Table persistence for maintaining learned knowledge
- Training with historical path data
- Epsilon-greedy strategy for balancing exploration and exploitation
- API endpoints for integration with the main application

For detailed documentation, see [QLearningGraphAgent Documentation](docs/q_learning_agent.md).

### CacheManager
The CacheManager is responsible for managing the short-term memory layer of the ECE using Redis. It provides both exact match caching and semantic (vector-based) caching to reduce latency and prepare the system for the real-time InjectorAgent.

**Key Features:**
- Exact match caching for fast retrieval of known data
- Semantic caching using vector similarity search
- Cache eviction policies (LRU, TTL)
- Cache statistics and monitoring
- High-performance operations with low latency
- Scalable design for high throughput

For detailed documentation, see [CacheManager Documentation](docs/cache_manager.md).

### ContextCache
The ContextCache is the high-speed, short-term memory layer of the ECE, corresponding to Tier 1. It is a passive component implemented using Redis Stack and is managed exclusively by the `Orchestrator` agent to provide fast retrieval of recent and semantically similar information.

**Key Features:**
- Managed component with all operations controlled by the `Orchestrator`
- Redis Stack integration for efficient key-value storage and vector similarity search
- Semantic search capabilities using vector embeddings
- Cache statistics tracking for performance monitoring

### WebSearchAgent
Performs web searches to gather external context.

### MultiModalIngestionAgent
Processes and ingests multi-modal content such as images, videos, and documents.

### CoherenceAgent
Ensures coherence and consistency in context and responses.

### SafetyAgent
Ensures the safety and appropriateness of content and responses.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd External-Context-Engine
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

The system is configured through `config.yaml`. Key configuration options include:

- Agent-specific settings
- Intent routing keywords
- Logging configuration

## Usage

Start the server:
```bash
python src/external_context_engine/main.py
```
