ANCHOR MCP MODULES ARCHIVED

This directory previously contained the embedded MCP server (server.py), client (client.py),
security utilities (security.py), and related tests. These modules have been moved to the
archive for rework and to remove the runtime dependency on MCP.

Archived location:
archive/removed_tool_protocols/mcp-utcp/anchor/mcp/

If you need to restore the MCP modules, copy the relevant files from that archive path back
into this directory and run tests to verify behavior.
